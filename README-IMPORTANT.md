DISCLAIMER!!!

When the task was given to us, I had no idea that it would have been the cornerstone of tomorrow's performance evaluation.
Hence, I figured that I would "experiment" with it a little bit, so to say.

Feeling that I hadn't a good enough understanding - usage of CSS pseudo-selectors, they are HEAVILY employed in this project, to the
extent of being quite confusing - not very intuitive at times (I also tried hard to keep classes and id's to a bare minimum, I actually
LIKE to use classes).

I also organized my CSS by trying the following order: variables, global, tags, utility-classes, classes, id's, pseudo-selectors (every 
group sorted in the order of appearance in HTML)

All the above also gave me a chance of working on the issue (also voiced by Michele in one of his feedbacks) of comments (or lack thereof).
I've done that by heavily commenting HTML and CSS to help navigate trough all the pseudo-selectors.
